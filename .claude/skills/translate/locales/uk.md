# Ukrainian (uk) — Formal (ви)

- Use formal "ви" address consistently
- "staking" = "стейкiнг" — same transliteration pattern as Russian but with Ukrainian orthography
- "restaking" = "рестейкiнг" — NEVER native calques
- "unstaking" = "зняти зi стейкiнгу" — NEVER meaningless calques like "ненаставлений"
- "claim" (DeFi) = "отримати" — NEVER "заклеймити" (= to brand/stigmatize, same catastrophic error as Russian)
- "seed phrase" = "сiд-фраза" — NEVER literal "фраза-насiння" (= phrase of seeds, meaningless)
- Verify morphological correctness — Ukrainian agglutination rules differ from Russian; incorrect suffixes produce meaningless words
- "liquidity pool" = "пул лiквiдностi" — standard transliteration matching Russian pattern
- "dust" (in crypto context, meaning tiny leftover amounts) must stay in English — do NOT translate as "пил"
