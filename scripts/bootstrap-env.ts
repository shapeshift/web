 * - an environment name
 * - empty, and the script will try to infer the environment from the branch name
 *
 * e.g.
 * - `yarn env app` will load the .env.app file and write out a .env file
 * - `yarn env` will try and read the branch name from process.env and map it to an environment
 *
 * this script can be called one of two ways
 * without args - `yarn env` in CI in GitHub Actions - where we inject process.env.CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME
 * see cloudflare.yml for more details
 * we have develop | main | release | private | yeet branches configured
 * and these branches map to the environments in BRANCH_TO_ENVIRONMENT above
 *
 * or `yarn env dev` and we're running locally and we use the radical dev config
