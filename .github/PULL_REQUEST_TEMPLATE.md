## Issue (if applicable)

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If applicable, please link to the github issue and put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

## Risk

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outline the scope of your changes and the risk associated with them. You must use your discretion as an engineer to determine the potential impact of your changes.

E.g. an upgrade to `hdwallet` or core state management would be considered higher risk, and might require a full regression test. UI or isolated view changes, or something behind a feature flag may have near zero risk. Small bug fixes might require testing isolated to the specific fix.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

## Testing

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your testing steps are technical, outline steps for an engineer to verify.

If your testing steps are functional, please provide a full guide with any features requiring special attention for operations to test your branch in the preview environment.
