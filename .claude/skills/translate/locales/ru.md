# Russian (ru) — Formal (vы)

- Use formal "vы" address consistently
- "staking" = "стейкинг" — NEVER "ставка" (= gambling bet) or "стейкировать" (malformed verb)
- "restaking" = "рестейкинг" — NEVER "переставка" (= rearranging physical objects, catastrophically wrong)
- "unstaking" = "снять со стейкинга" — NEVER native calques that produce meaningless words
- "claim" (DeFi) = "получить" — NEVER "заклеймить" (= to brand/stigmatize, catastrophically wrong)
- "seed phrase" = "сид-фраза" — transliterated loanword, standard in Russian crypto community
- Prefer transliterated English DeFi loanwords over native Russian calques (e.g., "бридж" not "мост" for bridge)
- "liquidity pool" = "пул ликвидности" — "пул" is the standard transliteration
