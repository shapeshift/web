      },
      "why": {
        "title": "Why stake your FOX?",
        "body": "Staking your FOX allows you to earn regular RUNE payouts from the DAO's treasury, providing a steady stream of passive income in RUNE per epoch. Additionally, a portion of the RUNE received by the DAO is used to buy FOX from the open market and burn it, reducing the overall supply. Staking also supports the ShapeShift DAO's alignment with the THORChain ecosystem, contributing to their growth and success. The staking process requires a minimum 28-day unstaking period, encouraging commitment and stability within the community."

      "stake": {
        "title": "How do I stake my FOX?",
        "body": "To stake your FOX, you use the staking interface to lock your FOX tokens into the staking contract. You will need to sign a message or transaction to assign the address where your RUNE rewards will be paid. Once staked, you start earning RUNE rewards per block as part of your staking benefits."

The total FOX staked influences the distribution of RUNE rewards, as rewards are distributed pro-rata based on the amount of FOX staked. The emissions pool represents the amount of FOX available for staking rewards, and the FOX burn amount is the portion of FOX purchased and burned using the RUNE collected from fees."
