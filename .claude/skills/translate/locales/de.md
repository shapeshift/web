# German (de) — Formal (Sie)

- Use formal "Sie" address consistently
- Use verb infinitives for action buttons (e.g., "Einzahlen" not "Einzahlung")
- Compound nouns as one word without hyphens (e.g., "Gasgebuhr" not "Gas-Gebuhr")
- Use established German financial terms
- Translate English adjectives — don't leave English untranslated unless in glossary
- Do not invent compound nouns that don't exist in German — if no established compound exists, use a short phrase or keep the English term
- "claim" in DeFi context = "Einfordern" (not "Anfordern" or "Beanspruchen")
- "dust" stays English (glossary never-translate) — not "Staub" (physical dust)
- Separable verb imperatives with "Sie": the prefix goes to end of clause (e.g., "Fordern Sie Ihre Belohnungen ein")
- Watch for typos in technical terms: "Miner" not "Mincer", "Token" not "Toke"
