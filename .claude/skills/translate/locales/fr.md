# French (fr) — Formal (vous)

- Use formal "vous" address consistently
- "claim" (DeFi) verb = "réclamer", noun = "réclamation" — NEVER "réclame" (= advertisement in French)
- "supported" (feature/chain) = "pris(e) en charge" — not "supportée" (anglicism)
- Use consistent "vous" register: prefer "Veuillez + infinitive" for instructions, no mixed imperatives
- Keep product names exactly as-is: FOXy, rFOX, FOX Token are distinct products — never substitute one for another
- Prefer concise phrasing — French typically runs 30-40% longer than English, so trim filler words
- "seed phrase" = "phrase de récupération" — never literal "phrase de graine" or "phrase de semences"
- "unstake" = "déstaker" — coined French DeFi verb, consistent throughout
- "liquidity pool" = "pool de liquidités" — never "piscine"
