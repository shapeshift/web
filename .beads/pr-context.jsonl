When a user selects WC as a wallet option in ShapeShift and scans the QR with Keplr/Leap/Cosmostation mobile, ShapeShift should be able to propose a session with cosmos namespace and handle cosmos_getAccounts, cosmos_signDirect, cosmos_signAmino responses.\n\n## Research Steps (before coding)\n1. Read @walletconnect/universal-provider source/docs to understand init() and connect() API differences vs EthereumProvider\n2. Read packages/hdwallet-core/src/cosmos.ts for CosmosWallet interface (cosmosGetAddress, cosmosSignTx)\n3. Read packages/hdwallet-core/src/wallet.ts for supportsCosmos() guard function\n4. Check how hdwallet-native implements CosmosWallet for reference pattern\n5. Read the existing adapter.ts to understand EthereumProvider.init() flow that needs migration\n6. Check if @walletconnect/universal-provider is already in package.json or needs adding\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Universal Provider Migration (packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/)\n- adapter.ts: Replace `import { EthereumProvider } from '@walletconnect/ethereum-provider'` with `import UniversalProvider from '@walletconnect/universal-provider'`\n- adapter.ts: Change `EthereumProvider.init(config)` to `UniversalProvider.init({ projectId, metadata })` then `provider.connect({ optionalNamespaces })`\n- The UniversalProvider has a different API: init() creates the provider, connect() establishes the session with namespaces\n- walletconnectV2.ts: Change `provider: EthereumProvider` type to `provider: UniversalProvider`\n- walletconnectV2.ts: Add `readonly _supportsCosmos = true` and `readonly _supportsCosmosInfo = true`\n- walletconnectV2.ts: Implement CosmosWallet interface methods\n\n### Phase 2: Cosmos Wallet Methods (packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/)\n- Create new file `cosmos.ts` following the pattern of `ethereum.ts`\n- Implement `cosmosGetAddress()`: extract from session.namespaces.cosmos.accounts (CAIP-10 format cosmos:cosmoshub-4:\u003cbech32addr\u003e)\n- Implement `cosmosSignTx(msg: CosmosSignTx)`: convert to cosmos_signAmino params and call provider.request()\n- The provider.request() for cosmos needs the chainId param: `provider.request({ method: 'cosmos_signAmino', params: {...} }, 'cosmos:cosmoshub-4')`\n\n### Phase 3: Config Updates (src/context/WalletProvider/WalletConnectV2/)\n- config.ts: Add cosmos chain config alongside EVM chains\n- config.ts: Update EthereumProviderOptions type to match UniversalProvider's options\n- constants.ts: Check if types need updating for the new provider\n\n### Key Files to Modify\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/adapter.ts (provider migration)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/walletconnectV2.ts (add Cosmos interface)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/cosmos.ts (NEW - cosmos methods)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/index.ts (export cosmos)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/package.json (add @walletconnect/universal-provider dep)\n- src/context/WalletProvider/WalletConnectV2/config.ts (cosmos chain config)\n\n### Cosmos RPC Methods\n- cosmos_getAccounts: {} -\u003e [{ algo, address, pubkey }]\n- cosmos_signAmino: { signerAddress, signDoc: { chain_id, account_number, sequence, memo, msgs, fee } } -\u003e { signature: { pub_key, signature }, signed }\n- cosmos_signDirect: { signerAddress, signDoc: { chainId, accountNumber, authInfoBytes, bodyBytes } } -\u003e { signature: { pub_key, signature }, signed }\n\n### Testing\n- Unit tests for cosmos.ts methods (cosmosGetAddress, cosmosSignTx)\n- Ensure existing ethereum tests still pass after provider migration\n- Mock UniversalProvider for test isolation\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- yarn type-check passes\n- yarn lint --fix passes\n- All existing WC tests still pass (no regression from provider migration)\n- User can scan QR with Keplr mobile and get cosmos address exposed in ShapeShift\n- cosmos_signAmino and cosmos_signDirect requests are properly proxied to the mobile wallet\n- PR targets origin/develop with proper description","notes":"GitHub issue: https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907 - PR body must include '- tackles https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907'","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"contact@0xgom.es","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:20:10.872061+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot","updated_at":"2026-02-17T14:22:00.614718+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T14:22:00.614718+01:00","close_reason":"Cosmos WCV2 wallet support implemented in PR #11909.

Use `WalletConnectSigningModal` as the wrapper (provides PeerMeta, confirm/reject footer, account display)\n2. Create BTC-specific content components passed as children:\n   - **signMessage**: Reuse existing `MessageContent` component from `WalletConnectSigningModal/content/MessageContent.tsx`\n   - **sendTransfer**: New `BitcoinSendTransferContent` - shows recipient address (with ExpandableCell), amount as BTC using `\u003cAmount.Crypto value={fromBaseUnit(amount, 8)} symbol={feeAsset.symbol} /\u003e` (NOT raw sats), optional memo\n   - **signPsbt**: New `BitcoinPsbtContent` - parse PSBT with `@shapeshiftoss/bitcoinjs-lib` Psbt.fromBase64(), show: network (Bitcoin icon), number of inputs, number of outputs, total output amounts, broadcast flag, expandable raw PSBT data section (like Solana's expandable transaction data pattern). Use `Card borderRadius='2xl' p={4}` and `VStack spacing={3}` like Solana/EIP155 content components.\n3. Fix the sats display: use `fromBaseUnit(amount, feeAsset?.precision ?? 8)` and `Amount.Crypto` instead of raw sats translation key\n4. Match the WalletConnectSigningModal's `onConfirm` signature (accepts optional CustomTransactionData)\n\n## Files\n- `src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/components/modals/BitcoinSignConfirmation.tsx` - rewrite to use WalletConnectSigningModal\n- `src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/components/WalletConnectSigningModal/content/BitcoinSendTransferContent.tsx` - new\n- `src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/components/WalletConnectSigningModal/content/BitcoinPsbtContent.tsx` - new\n\n## Reference pattern\nSee how EIP155SignMessageConfirmation.tsx and SolanaSignMessageConfirmation.tsx use WalletConnectSigningModal + content children.\nSee SolanaTransactionContent.tsx for expandable transaction data pattern with useToggle, ChevronDown/UpIcon.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- BitcoinSignConfirmation uses WalletConnectSigningModal wrapper\n- All 3 BTC methods (signMessage, sendTransfer, signPsbt) display correctly\n- signMessage reuses MessageContent (no duplication)\n- sendTransfer shows BTC amount via Amount.Crypto (not raw sats)\n- signPsbt shows parsed details (inputs count, outputs with addresses/amounts, broadcast flag) with expandable raw data\n- Zero regressions in EIP155/Solana/Cosmos modals (only new files + rewritten BitcoinSignConfirmation)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"contact@0xgom.es","created_at":"2026-02-18T17:16:33.604185+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot","updated_at":"2026-02-18T17:25:08.474734+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-18T17:25:08.474734+01:00","close_reason":"Refactored BitcoinSignConfirmation to use WalletConnectSigningModal.

When ShapeShift acts as a wallet and an external Cosmos dApp connects via WC, handle cosmos_signAmino and cosmos_signDirect signing requests.\n\n## Research Steps (before coding)\n1. Read src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/utils/EIP155RequestHandlerUtil.ts as the reference pattern\n2. Read src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/utils/CosmosRequestHandlerUtil.ts for current partial implementation\n3. Read src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/utils/createApprovalNamespaces.ts - understand the isEvmChainId filter blocking non-EVM\n4. Read src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/WalletConnectModalManager.tsx - understand modal routing\n5. Read src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/eventsManager/useWalletConnectEventsHandler.ts - already routes cosmos methods\n6. Read packages/hdwallet-core/src/cosmos.ts for CosmosSignTx interface\n7. Check src/lib/utils/cosmosSdk.ts for assertGetCosmosSdkChainAdapter\n8. Read src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/components/modals/CosmosSignMessageConfirmation.tsx for existing modal\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Fix createApprovalNamespaces.ts\n- Remove isEvmChainId filter on lines 50-56 that silently drops non-EVM optional namespaces\n- Add DEFAULT_COSMOS_METHODS constant: ['cosmos_getAccounts', 'cosmos_signDirect', 'cosmos_signAmino']\n- Handle cosmos namespace in the optional namespaces section (same pattern as eip155)\n- Support cosmos accounts in CAIP-10 format: cosmos:cosmoshub-4:\u003cbech32addr\u003e\n\n### Phase 2: Complete CosmosRequestHandlerUtil.ts\n- Fix cosmos_signAmino handler: remove FIXME for fee (pass fee from signDoc), fix TODO comments\n- Implement cosmos_signDirect handler (currently returns hardcoded stub 'signedMessage')\n  - Parse authInfoBytes and bodyBytes from signDoc\n  - Route through chainAdapter.signTransaction with proper CosmosSignTx format\n- Add cosmos_getAccounts handler: return address + pubkey from portfolio state\n\n### Phase 3: Types \u0026 Events\n- Add cosmos request types for cosmos_getAccounts to types.ts\n- Ensure WalletConnectRequest union includes all cosmos types\n- Verify useWalletConnectEventsHandler routing is complete (it already handles cosmos methods)\n\n### Phase 4: Tests\n- Unit test CosmosRequestHandlerUtil for all three methods\n- Unit test createApprovalNamespaces with cosmos namespace proposals\n- Test that EVM-only wallets still work (no regression)\n\n### Key Files\n- src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/utils/createApprovalNamespaces.ts (fix non-EVM filtering)\n- src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/utils/CosmosRequestHandlerUtil.ts (complete implementation)\n- src/plugins/walletConnectToDapps/types.ts (add cosmos_getAccounts types)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- yarn type-check passes\n- yarn lint --fix passes\n- External Cosmos dApp can connect to ShapeShift via WC and request cosmos_signAmino/cosmos_signDirect\n- createApprovalNamespaces properly includes cosmos accounts in session approval\n- cosmos_signDirect actually signs (not stub)\n- Unit tests pass\n- PR targets origin/develop as draft","notes":"GitHub issue: https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907 - PR body must include '- tackles https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907'","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"contact@0xgom.es","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:20:22.424038+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot","updated_at":"2026-02-17T15:31:53.835124+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T15:31:53.835124+01:00","close_reason":"PR #11914 opened - cosmos wc dApps support with getAccounts, signAmino, signDirect, namespace approval, session proposal, network selection","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"shapeshiftWeb-asl","depends_on_id":"shapeshiftWeb-4cm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:21:24.054409+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot"}]}

Check Xverse WC docs for exact bip122 RPC method params/responses\n4. Read the universal-provider docs for bip122 namespace request() API\n5. Check @reown/appkit-adapter-bitcoin source for reference implementation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Bitcoin Methods (packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/)\n- Create new file bitcoin.ts following ethereum.ts pattern\n- btcGetAddress(): extract from session.namespaces.bip122.accounts CAIP-10 format\n  - Parse: bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93:\u003caddress\u003e -\u003e address\n- Handle sendTransfer: { account, recipientAddress, amount, memo? } -\u003e { txid }\n- Handle signPsbt: { account, psbt: base64, signInputs, broadcast? } -\u003e { psbt: base64, txid? }\n- Handle signMessage: { account, message, protocol? } -\u003e { signature, address }\n\n### Phase 2: HDWallet Class Updates (walletconnectV2.ts)\n- Change `readonly _supportsBTC = false` to `true`\n- Add `readonly _supportsBTCInfo = true`\n- Implement BTCWallet interface methods that make sense for WC\n- Store BTC address from session\n\n### Phase 3: Config Updates\n- Add bip122 to optionalNamespaces in config.ts\n- Chain: bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93\n- Methods: ['sendTransfer', 'signPsbt', 'signMessage', 'getAccountAddresses']\n- Events: ['bip122_addressesChanged']\n\n### Phase 4: Tests\n- Unit tests for bitcoin.ts methods\n- Mock UniversalProvider for test isolation\n\n### Key Files\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/bitcoin.ts (NEW)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/walletconnectV2.ts (enable BTC)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/index.ts (export)\n- src/context/WalletProvider/WalletConnectV2/config.ts (add bip122 namespace)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- yarn type-check passes, yarn lint --fix passes\n- User can scan QR with Xverse mobile and get BTC address\n- BTC PSBTs can be signed via WC\n- PR targets origin/develop as draft","notes":"GitHub issue: https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907 - PR body must include '- tackles https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907'","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"contact@0xgom.es","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:21:09.922627+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot","updated_at":"2026-02-17T15:24:19.079983+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T15:24:19.079983+01:00","close_reason":"Bitcoin WCV2 wallet support implemented in PR #11913","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"shapeshiftWeb-bk0","depends_on_id":"shapeshiftWeb-4cm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:21:23.99111+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot"}]}

When a user selects WC as a wallet and scans with Phantom/Solflare/Trust Wallet/Backpack mobile, ShapeShift should handle the solana namespace.\n\n## Mobile Wallets That Support Solana via WC QR\n- Phantom (extension only, NOT mobile QR - uses in-app browser)\n- Solflare (confirmed mobile QR)\n- Trust Wallet (confirmed mobile QR, listed in WalletGuide)\n- Backpack (confirmed, WCT airdrop partner)\n- OKX Wallet (confirmed mobile QR)\n- Binance Wallet (confirmed)\n\n## Research Steps\n1. Read packages/hdwallet-core/src/solana.ts for SolanaWallet interface (solanaGetAddress, solanaSignTx, solanaSendTx)\n2. Read packages/hdwallet-core/src/wallet.ts for supportsSolana() guard\n3. Check how hdwallet-native implements SolanaWallet for reference\n4. Read the universal-provider docs for solana namespace request() API\n5. Check packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/ethereum.ts for the pattern to follow\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Phase 1: Solana Methods (packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/)\n- Create new file solana.ts following ethereum.ts pattern\n- solanaGetAddress(): extract pubkey from session.namespaces.solana.accounts CAIP-10 format\n  - Parse: solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp:\u003cbase58-pubkey\u003e -\u003e pubkey\n- solanaSignTx(msg: SolanaSignTx): \n  - Build VersionedTransaction using solanaBuildTransaction() from hdwallet-core\n  - Serialize to base64\n  - Call provider.request({ method: 'solana_signTransaction', params: { transaction: base64 } }, 'solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp')\n  - Parse response signature\n- solanaSendTx(msg: SolanaSignTx):\n  - Same as above but use solana_signAndSendTransaction method\n  - Return tx signature\n\n### Phase 2: HDWallet Class Updates (walletconnectV2.ts)\n- Add `readonly _supportsSolana = true` and `readonly _supportsSolanaInfo = true`\n- Implement SolanaWallet interface: solanaGetAddress, solanaSignTx, solanaSendTx\n- Add solanaGetAccountPaths, solanaNextAccountPath from hdwallet-core helpers\n- Store solana address from session (like ethAddress pattern)\n\n### Phase 3: Config Updates\n- Add solana to optionalNamespaces in config.ts\n- Add Solana RPC URL from env config (VITE_SOLANA_NODE_URL)\n- Methods: ['solana_signTransaction', 'solana_signAndSendTransaction', 'solana_signMessage', 'solana_signAllTransactions']\n\n### Phase 4: Tests\n- Unit tests for solana.ts (solanaGetAddress, solanaSignTx, solanaSendTx)\n- Mock UniversalProvider for test isolation\n\n### Key Files\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/solana.ts (NEW)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/walletconnectV2.ts (add Solana interface)\n- packages/hdwallet-walletconnectv2/src/index.ts (export)\n- src/context/WalletProvider/WalletConnectV2/config.ts (add solana namespace)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- yarn type-check passes\n- yarn lint --fix passes\n- User can scan QR with Solflare/Trust Wallet mobile and get solana address\n- Solana transactions can be signed and broadcast via WC\n- PR targets origin/develop as draft","notes":"GitHub issue: https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907 - PR body must include '- tackles https://github.com/shapeshift/web/issues/11907'","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"contact@0xgom.es","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:20:34.414235+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot","updated_at":"2026-02-17T15:31:56.909527+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-17T15:31:56.909527+01:00","close_reason":"Solana WCV2 wallet support implemented in PR #11911","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"shapeshiftWeb-jil","depends_on_id":"shapeshiftWeb-4cm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-17T13:21:23.875025+01:00","created_by":"gomes-bot"}]}
