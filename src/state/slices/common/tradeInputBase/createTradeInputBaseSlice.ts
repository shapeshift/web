/**
 * Creates a reusable Redux slice for trade input functionality. This is a higher-order slice
 * factory that generates a slice with common trade-related reducers. It provides base functionality
 * for managing trade state like buy/sell assets, account IDs, amounts, and slippage preferences.
 * This allows multiple features (like trading and limit orders) to reuse the same reducer logic
 * while maintaining their own independent state.
 *
 * @param name - The name of the Redux slice
 * @param initialState - The initial state extending the base trade input state
 * @param extraReducers - Additional reducers specific to the implementing slice
 * @returns A configured Redux slice with all the base trade input reducers
