## What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is the industry standard protocol that allows ShapeShift to securely connect with external wallets and decentralized applications (DApps). Think of it as a bridge that enables secure communication without ever sharing private keys.

## How ShapeShift Uses WalletConnect

ShapeShift implements WalletConnect in two ways:

### 1. [WalletConnect Wallet](./walletconnect-wallet.md)
Connect external wallets to ShapeShift using WalletConnect. Users can manage crypto assets from MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Zerion, and other wallets through ShapeShift's interface.

### 2. [WalletConnect to dApps](./walletconnect-dapps.md)
Connect ShapeShift wallet to DApps. Users can interact with Uniswap, OpenSea, Aave and other DApps using ShapeShift as their wallet.
