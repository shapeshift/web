# Portuguese — Brazil (pt) — Informal (voce)

- Use informal "voce" address consistently
- "claim" (DeFi) = "resgatar" — not "reivindicar" (sounds legalistic/formal in Brazilian Portuguese)
- "seed phrase" = "frase de recuperacao" — never literal "frase de sementes"
- Keep English DeFi loanwords where Brazilian crypto community uses them directly: unstaking, restaking, staking
- "liquidity pool" = "pool de liquidez" — never "piscina de liquidez"
- "unstake" action = "remover stake" — not "desbloquear" (unlock) which has different semantics
- "streaming swap" = "troca de streaming" — keep "streaming" as loanword
