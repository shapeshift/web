description: Dismiss onboarding, unlock native wallet, verify trade page loads with swap inputs and button
route: /trade
steps:
  - name: Dismiss onboarding and banners
    instruction: >
      After opening the page, check if an onboarding/splash dialog appears
      (e.g. "ShapeShift Wallet" with "Skip" and "Next" buttons, mentioning "Self-Custody").
      If it appears, click the "Skip" button to dismiss it.
      If no onboarding dialog appears (you see the password prompt or the trade page directly), skip this step.
      Also check for a cookie/tracking banner at the bottom of the page ("Our dApp uses
      anonymized click tracking...") with a "Got It" button. If present, click "Got It" to dismiss it.
      This banner can block interactions with other elements if left open.
    expected: The onboarding dialog is dismissed (or was never shown), no cookie banner visible
    screenshot: true
  - name: Fill wallet password
    instruction: >
      Wait for the "Enter Your Password" dialog to appear.
      Click on the native wallet button (e.g. "teest" or "test") to select it if not already selected.
      Once the password input and "Next" button appear, focus the password input using JS eval
      (click --ref often times out on external origins):
      eval "document.querySelector('input[type=password], input[placeholder*=Password]')?.focus()"
      Then type $NATIVE_WALLET_PASSWORD character by character using press
      (agent-browser fill does not trigger React onChange - use press for each char).
    expected: Password field is filled (shows masked dots), Next button is enabled and clickable
    screenshot: true
  - name: Unlock wallet
    instruction: >
      Click the "Next" button to submit the password. On external origins where click --ref
      may time out, use JS eval:
      eval "Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button')).find(b => b.textContent.trim() === 'Next')?.click()"
      Wait for the wallet to fully unlock and the app to load (no more password dialog).
      Wait at least 8 seconds for external origins to fully hydrate.
    expected: The wallet is unlocked and the app shows the main interface (no password prompt visible)
    screenshot: true
  - name: Page loads
    instruction: Verify the trade page has fully loaded with the swap interface visible
    expected: The trade page is visible with a swap interface (Swap heading, asset selectors)
    screenshot: true
  - name: Sell input visible
    instruction: Look for the sell/from asset input field
    expected: A sell asset input field is visible with an asset selector
    screenshot: true
  - name: Buy input visible
    instruction: Look for the buy/to asset input field
    expected: A buy asset input field is visible with an asset selector
    screenshot: true
  - name: Swap button exists
    instruction: Look for the swap/trade action button
    expected: A swap or trade button is present on the page
    screenshot: true
