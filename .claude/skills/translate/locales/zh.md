# Chinese — Simplified (zh) — Neutral/formal

- Use crypto-community terms: 授权 not 批准 (approve), 回滚 not 恢复 (revert)
- Don't add words not in the English source
- "trade" = 交易 (broader); "swap" = 兑换 (token exchange) — do not use 兑换 for "trade"
- Always use full-width Chinese punctuation (。？！) not half-width (.?!)
- Use 您 (formal "you") in error/status messages, not 你 (informal)
- "dust" stays English (glossary never-translate) — not 灰尘 (physical dust) or 小额资金 (small funds)
- "streaming swap" = 流式兑换 — not 流动兑换 (流动 means "flowing/liquid", 流式 means "streaming-style")
- "allowance" (token approval) = 授权额度 — not unrelated terms
- Reinforce: 授权 (authorize) for on-chain approve — skill has violated this existing rule, be strict
