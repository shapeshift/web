# WalletConnect Feature Documentation

## What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is the industry standard protocol that allows ShapeShift to securely connect with external wallets and decentralized applications (DApps). Think of it as a bridge that enables secure communication without ever sharing private keys.

## How ShapeShift Uses WalletConnect

ShapeShift implements WalletConnect in two ways:

### 1. [WalletConnect Wallet](./walletconnect-wallet.md)
Connect ShapeShift to external wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Zerion. Users can manage their crypto assets stored in these wallets directly through ShapeShift's interface.

### 2. [WalletConnect dApps](./walletconnect-dapps.md)
Allow external DApps (like Uniswap, OpenSea, Aave) to connect to ShapeShift. Users can interact with these DApps while using ShapeShift as their wallet.

## Platform Support
