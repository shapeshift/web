# Rerenders

We use `react-scan` to detect components re-renders.

It is automatically enabled in localhost dev builds. To explicitly enable it when testing another env locally, go to src/index.ts, and change `enabled` to true.


For advanced usage, see [react-scan](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-scan) docs.
