# Turkish (tr) — Formal (siz)

- Use formal "siz" address consistently
- Verify correct vowel harmony in suffixes (e.g., "Parolayı" not "Parolay" — accusative requires buffer vowel)
- "claim" (DeFi) = "talep etmek" — NEVER "yuklemeler" (= uploads, completely wrong)
- Keep DeFi English loanwords where Turkish crypto community uses them: staking, restaking, swap
- When borrowing English terms, use apostrophe for Turkish suffixes (e.g., "Stake'i Kaldır")
