name: ETH to FOX Swap
description: Full ETH to FOX swap - select assets, enter amount, preview, sign, wait for completion
route: /trade
depends_on:
  - wallet-health.yaml
steps:
  - name: Dismiss stale notifications
    instruction: >
      Before starting the swap, dismiss any lingering notifications from previous swaps.
      Close any toast notifications, feedback dialogs ("How was your trade experience?"),
      or pending transaction banners by clicking their Close/X buttons.
      This prevents stale UI state from interfering with the current swap's completion detection.
    expected: No stale notifications visible
    screenshot: true
  - name: Select ETH as sell asset
    instruction: >
      Check if ETH is already the sell asset. If not, click the sell asset selector,
      search for ETH, and select "Ethereum (ETH)".
    expected: ETH is selected as the sell asset
    screenshot: true
  - name: Select FOX as buy asset
    instruction: >
      Click the buy/receive asset selector button (the one showing the current buy asset like BTC).
      In the asset picker dialog, type "FOX" in the search field.
      Click the FOX result - if it shows multiple chain avatars, click it once to expand,
      then click "Ethereum (FOX)" from the expanded list.
      Wait for the dialog to close and FOX to appear as the buy asset.
    expected: FOX is selected as the buy asset with a FOX balance shown
    screenshot: true
  - name: Toggle to fiat input
    instruction: >
      Click the "≈ $0.00" button below the sell amount to toggle to fiat/USD input mode.
      If already in fiat mode (placeholder shows "$0"), skip this step.
    expected: The input field is in fiat mode (placeholder shows $0, balance shows $ amount)
    screenshot: true
  - name: Enter swap amount
    instruction: >
      Click the sell amount textbox and type 0.10 character by character using press
      (NOT fill - React controlled inputs need keypress events).
      Wait a moment for the value to register.
    expected: $0.10 is entered in the sell field
    screenshot: true
  - name: Wait for quote
    instruction: >
      Wait up to 10 seconds for a swap quote to appear.
      The "You Get" field should show a FOX amount (not 0),
      and a rate like "1 ETH = X FOX" should appear.
      The "Preview Trade" button should become enabled (not disabled).
    expected: Quote is displayed with FOX receive amount, rate shown, Preview Trade button enabled
    screenshot: true
  - name: Preview trade
    instruction: >
      Click the "Preview Trade" button.
      Wait for the "Confirm Details" screen to appear showing swap details
      (sell amount, receive amount, swapper, fees).
    expected: Confirm Details screen visible with swap summary and "Confirm and Trade" button
    screenshot: true
  - name: Confirm and Trade
    instruction: >
      Click the "Confirm and Trade" button.
      This transitions to the Trade execution screen.
      A "Sign & Swap" button will appear, initially in a loading/disabled state.
      Wait up to 30 seconds for "Sign & Swap" to become enabled (no longer loading/disabled).
    expected: Sign & Swap button is visible and enabled (not loading, not disabled)
    screenshot: true
  - name: Sign and Swap
    instruction: >
      Click the "Sign & Swap" button to sign and submit the transaction.
      The native wallet will sign the transaction automatically (no password prompt for native ETH sends).
      After clicking, the transaction is submitted on-chain.
    expected: Transaction submitted, swap execution in progress
    screenshot: true
  - name: Wait for completion
    instruction: >
      Wait for the swap to complete. The page will show "Awaiting swap" with a progress bar.
      When complete, it transitions back to the main trade page.
      A feedback dialog ("How was your trade experience?") may appear - dismiss it by clicking "Maybe Later" or "Close".
      Check that the buy asset balance has increased.
      Wait up to 120 seconds, checking every 5 seconds.
      Look for: the trade page reappearing, a feedback dialog, success notification, or the
      "Awaiting swap" text disappearing.
    expected: Swap completed - back on trade page, FOX balance increased, no more "Awaiting swap"
    screenshot: true
  - name: Clean up notifications
    instruction: >
      After confirming the swap completed, dismiss any remaining notifications or dialogs
      (feedback dialog, success toast, etc.) by clicking Close/X/Maybe Later buttons.
      This leaves a clean state for any subsequent fixture that depends on this one.
    expected: Trade page is clean with no overlaying notifications or dialogs
    screenshot: true
